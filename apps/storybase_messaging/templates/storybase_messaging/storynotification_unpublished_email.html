Template for unpublished story notification HTML email

Available context variables:

* story - Story model instance for the notification
* unpublished_stories - List of user's unpublished stories
* recent_stories - List of three most recently published stories, site-wide
* viewer_url - Full URL (including hostname) of the story viewer for the story
* explorer_url - Full URL (including hostname) of the explore page
* detail_url - Full URL (including hostname) of the detail page for the story

For maximum compatibility with different email clients, we should use inline
styles instead of stylesheets.  Here are the styles that you can copy and
paste as you update:

table {
  /* General font styles, put this on the outermost table element */
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;  color: rgb(38, 38, 38);
}

a {
  color: rgb(50, 197, 244);
}

h2 {
  font-size: 16px;
}

			        <p>Dear {{ story.author.first_name }},</p>
				<p>We noticed you haven’t published the story you started, <a href="{{ detail_url }}{% ga_campaign_params "floodlight" "email reminder" "unpublished story reminder" %}" title ="{{ story.title }}" style="color: rgb(50, 197, 244);">{{ story.title }}</a>. You can open this story in the <a href="{{ builder_url }}{% ga_campaign_params "floodlight" "email reminder" "unpublished story reminder" %}" style="color: rgb(50, 197, 244);"> story builder</a>. 
                                <p>Feeling stuck? It happens to everyone. Here are some tips to get unstuck:</p>
				<h2 style="font-size: 16px;">Let it all out</h2>
                                <p>"Anything can be rewritten--except nothing." - Joss Whedon</p>

				<p>There’s nothing scarier than a blank slate. Free-writing is the process of getting all of your thoughts out in the open, no matter how messy they are. Set a timer for 10 minutes and don’t let your pen stop moving or fingers stop typing until the clock runs down. It’s ok if you’ve written gibberish. You can always go back and edit your ideas into a spectacular story.</p>

				<h2 style="font-size: 16px;">Try a different medium</h2>

				<p>If you’re story is highly visual, try writing instead. Already have a lot written? Record yourself telling the story -- out loud, no notes. Draw a picture that illustrates your story, or create a slideshow or video of it. How would you tell your story with LEGO blocks? When you switch to a new tool, you often find a new voice.</p>

				<h2 style="font-size: 16px;">Give yourself a deadline</h2>

				<p>A clock ticking down is a storyteller’s best friend. Try breaking your story into manageable chunks and give yourself intermediate deadlines: complete at least one section by the end of the day, finish editing the photos and writing captions by the end of the week, etc. If you aren’t good at setting your own deadlines, ask a friend or colleague to hold you accountable.</p>

				<h2 style="font-size: 16px;">Share your story with someone you trust</h2>

				<p>Unleashing your story for the world to see is a daunting task, so try showing it to someone you trust first. Your story is better than you think, and getting feedback before you publish it will boost your confidence.  Tip: If you preview your Floodlight story, you can use the link to share it with others -- even if it’s not published yet.</p>
